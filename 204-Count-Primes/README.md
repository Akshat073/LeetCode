## Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, return *the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than* `n`.

A **prime number** is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10: 2, 3, 5, 7.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= n <= 5 * 10^6`


## Time Complexity

- **Time:** O(n log log n)
- **Space:** O(n)
